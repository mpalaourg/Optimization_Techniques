# Optimization Techniques 1st Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Find the minimum of convex functions [1-D].

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Optimization Techniques" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment was to compare the results of different search algorithms applied to -strictly- convex functions. The algorithms used were:
<ul>
<li> Bisection Method, </li>
<li> Golden Section Method, </li>
<li> Golden Section Method, </li>
<li> Fibonacci Method, </li>
<li> Bisection Method (<i>using derivative</i>).</li>
</ul>
</p>
