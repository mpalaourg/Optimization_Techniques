# Optimization Techniques 4th Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Find the minimum of a function, with constraints [2-D].

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Optimization Techniques" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment  was to apply the method of <b>Steepest Descent</b> in two cases and compare the results. Firstly, implemented for a function f(x), for which no constraints apply and then used to minimize the same function in the presence of constraints.
