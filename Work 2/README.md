# Optimization Techniques 2nd Assignment, AUTh [2018]
> Find the minimum of a function [2-D].

<p align="justify">
This is an <i>experimental</i> application developed as part of the course "Optimization Techniques" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2018.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The goal of this assignment was to apply two methods, <b>Steepest Descent</b> and <b>Newton</b> method, to function f(x), for which there was no analytic formula, only access to the numerical values of f(x), grad_f(x) and hessian_f(x), where x is a [2x1] vector.
